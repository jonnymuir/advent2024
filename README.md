# Advent of Code 2024 (Rust)

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 challenges, written in Rust. The purpose of this project is to learn Rust while solving advent of code.

### Project Structure

Each day's solution is in its own directory, named `day1`, `day2`, `day3`, and so on. The main solution logic for each day is typically found within the `main` function of the corresponding `src/main.rs` file.

### Building and Running

To build and run a specific day's solution, navigate to its directory and execute the following commands:

```bash
cd day1  # Replace 1 with the desired day number
cargo run
```

This will compile and run the Rust code for that day. 

### Contributing

While this is primarily a personal learning project, feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or suggest improvements. Pull requests are welcome, especially if they contribute to better code quality or performance. 

**Note:** This is a work in progress, and solutions may be updated or improved over time.
